      In October 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg
      is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm,
      Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his LiveJournal
      blog. He creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college
      databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors
      to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of
      Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic
      probation. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of twins
      Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra.
      The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social
      network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Zuckerberg
      approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for Thefacebook, a
      social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students.
      Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the
      website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook,
      the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg
      stole their idea while keeping them in the dark by stalling on developing
      the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard
      President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in either
      disciplinary action or Thefacebook.

      What Mike Zuckerberg's said about the movie was that it was boring so they
      made stuff up. here is a quote about his opinion on the movie :

      >I think the reality is that writing code and then building a product and
      building a company is not a glamorous enough thing to make a movie about,
      so you can imagine that a lot of this stuff they had to embellish or make
      up,</q
